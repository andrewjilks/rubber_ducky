Overview for remaining functionality implementation

Default/Reset state:

	Switching logic for functions in the index this mode is swapped into
	if the state is changed then recieves the packet to update the NVS

Serial communicator mode:

	The most important thing for the main functionality of this module 
	is that it will be very base level. When recieving packets over
	wired connection then it is already setup to parse

WIFI mode:

	The user will be prompted to connect to wireless networks that
	have been configured in config mode. As well as set up wireless
	packet mode

GPIO mode:

	Execute code stored on the device to use the gpio pins for
	controlling electric devices

Bluetooth mode:

	This mode will be used primarily for device pairing and running 
	bluetooth related device code 

Debug mode:

	In this mode the user can view debug logs and access error handling
	functionality

Config mode:

	Users can configure various settings on the device including;
	stored code files, network credentials, circuit layout files,
